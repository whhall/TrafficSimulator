This is a sample of graphical Java using Swing.  Each class has its own individual unit test.

# How to Use this Package

Make sure you have JDK installed.  You can then compile the entire package and run the Graphical.java file to see the program in action. You can move the road on the window by clicking and dragging anywhere on the window.  To control the speed of the vehicles on the road then press the + or - to speed up or slow down the traffic.  The settings can be adjusted to control the percent chance of each vehicle to spawn in the settings menu in the header.
